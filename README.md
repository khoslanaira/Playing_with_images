### **playing_with_images.py**

**Description**:
This script demonstrates basic image manipulation techniques using Python and OpenCV, focusing on transposing and displaying images. It includes the following features:

- **Image Transposition**: Transposes an image along specified axes to achieve different effects, such as flipping or rotating the image.
- **Image Display Function**: Utilizes Matplotlib and OpenCV to render images in a user-friendly format. The function ensures images are converted from BGR to RGB for accurate color display.

**Key Functions**:
- `np.transpose()`: Reorders the axes of an image array for transformations.
- `display_image()`: Displays an image with a title, using OpenCV for color conversion and Matplotlib for rendering.
